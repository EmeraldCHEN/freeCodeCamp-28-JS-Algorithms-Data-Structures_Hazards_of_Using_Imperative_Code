Functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

This program is using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect output. The final list of open tabs should be ['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab'] but the output will be slightly different. 

So I've worked through the code and then figured out the problem to get the expected result.
